# insane-architects
processing, this is not a sketch but designed to run in eclipse (other IDEs should work too)...
just put the .jar files included into your build path and run the crunch.insanearchitects.InsaneArchitecsSketch as an Applet..
Let me know if you are having problems building the project!

# Happy Processing!
